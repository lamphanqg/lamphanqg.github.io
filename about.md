![My photo](/assets/images/about_image.jpg)

(I'm on the left)

I'm a SE/BrSE from Vietnam. I used to live in Saitama and now moved to Himeshima, an island in Oita Prefecture, Japan. My experience is mainly about coding in PHP and Ruby, as well as connecting Vietnamese and Japanese team members.

## Education

I graduated from Business Management department of Ritsumeikan Asia Pacific University. My major was Accounting, but I jumped to programming jobs right after 3 weeks of probation period for an audit position in PwC Vietnam (It was too formal, and too much extrovert-oriented for me).

My programming skills are learnt partly from my Pascal programming course in highschool, and 4 programming courses with VB.net in college. After graduation, I'm continuing to learn proramming and PM skills from MOOC courses (Coursera is my favorite), articles, books, and recently from a Vietnamese programmer community.

## Work Experience

*Under maintenance...*

## What I want

Currently, I would like to have a job where I can practice and enhance my programming skills. Recently I'm looking into some following topics:

* TDD in Rails with Rspec
* Vuejs
* Typescript
* Elixir
* EC
* Chat application
* Agriculture & gardening (I have a small garden near my house, where I enjoy growing my veggies)
* Data analysis and visualization (like in business intelligence systems)
* Design system (in order to make peace between designers and developers)

## What I don't want

* Too much management stuff (Basically it's what I'm doing, and I think I am in the best place for this kind of job)
* Pulic speaking (I have a strong speech anxiety, even in my native language, and even through a phone)

## Tech stack

  * Ruby on Rails
  * Capybara
* Docker (mainly docker-compose)
* Vagrant

  * FuelPHP
  * CodeIgniter
* Python
* Octave (tried it when I take a course in machine learning)
* Vue (basic use only)
* Swift
* nginx

### Have interest in, but not have enough time to write anything

* Vue as a framework to build SPA

* Go
* Java

## Language ability

### English

I have learned it for 15 years, got IELTS 6.5 in 2010 in order to come to my college. It's the main language used in all my college classes, so I think I have no problem using English in business enviroment.

### Japanese

I started Japanese from college, and mostly learned it in part-time jobs, daily life problem solving, and my current job. I've obtained N1 in 2017.
