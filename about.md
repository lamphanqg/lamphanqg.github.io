(I'm on the left)

I'm a Ruby on Rails developer from Vietnam. I used to live in Beppu (Oita), Saitama, then Himeshima (Oita) and now moved to Himeji, a city with a very beautiful castle in Hyogo, Japan. My experience has been mainly about coding in Ruby, as well as connecting Vietnamese and Japanese team members.

## Education

I graduated from Business Management department of Ritsumeikan Asia Pacific University. My major was Accounting, but I jumped to programming jobs right after 3 weeks of probation period for an audit position in PwC Vietnam (It was too formal, and too much extrovert-oriented for me).

My programming skills are learnt partly from my Pascal programming course in highschool, and 4 programming courses with VB.net in college. After graduation, I'm continuing to learn proramming and PM skills from MOOC courses (Coursera is my favorite), articles, books, and recently from a Vietnamese programmer community.

## Work Experience

* Backend Engineer in YAMAP Inc., Sep 2022 - Present
* System Engineer in Ruby Development Inc., Sep 2019 - Aug 2022
* System Engineer in Neolab Inc., Dec 2015 - Sep 2019

## What I want

Currently, I would like to have a job where I can enhance my programming and system design skills. Recently I'm looking into some following topics:

* Modular Monolith
* Schema-driven development
* Database performance (especially PostgreSQL)
* Geodata with PostGIS, RGeo, Mapbox, etc.
* TDD in Rails with Rspec
* Data analysis and visualization (like in business intelligence systems)

## What I don't want

* Too much management stuff (Basically it's what I'm doing, and I think I am in the best place for this kind of job)
* Pulic speaking (I have a strong speech anxiety, even in my native language, and even through a phone)

## Tech stack

### Have experience, able to use quickly with support of google search

* Ruby, Rails, RSpec, Capybara
* Docker (mainly docker-compose), Vagrant
* Javascript (jQuery, Vue)
* Python, Flask
* PHP, Laravel
* git
* shell script
* Apache, nginx
* puma, Passenger
* CircleCI, Github Actions, CodeBuild, CodePipeline

### Tried some times, easy to read, may take time to use

* PHP
  * FuelPHP
  * CodeIgniter
* Octave (tried it when I take a course in machine learning)
* Swift
* C# (used when I try to learn game programming with Unity)

### Have interest in, but not have enough time to write anything

* Rust
* Elixir

### Don't like much, but can learn if work requires

* React
* Go
* Java

## Language ability

### English

I have learned it for 15 years, got IELTS 6.5 in 2010 in order to come to my college. It's the main language used in all my college classes, so I think I have no problem using English in business enviroment.

### Japanese

I started Japanese from college, and mostly learned it in part-time jobs, daily life problem solving, and my current job. I've obtained N1 in 2017.
